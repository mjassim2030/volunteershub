## 🧰 Technologies Used
- ⚙️ JavaScript – game logic, AI behavior, DOM manipulation, and local storage handling
- 🎨 HTML5 – Structure of the web page and interactive elements
- 🖌️ CSS3 – Styling, and animations
- 📦 LocalStorage API – Storage of win counts across sessions, and first run how-to information
- 🔊 HTML5 Audio API – Integrated game sound effects for actions like click, win, and token drops
- 🧪 Dynamic DOM Rendering – Game board is generated based on player-selected dimensions
- 📐 Grid-Based Logic – Efficient token placement and win detection algorithms


## 🧠 Technical Highlights
- **DOM construction:** Board and cells are generated based on selected board size.
- **Token drop animation:** Tokens visually fall from the top cell to their final spot.
- **Winner detection:** Checks for 4 in raw combination of tokens in all directions.
- **AI behavior:**
    - **Easy:** Random column selection.
    - **Normal:** Tries to win or block opponent if none then random columns selection.
